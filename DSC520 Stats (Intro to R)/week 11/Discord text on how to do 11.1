@Michael Gonzalez#9261  and other folks, I'll try here to outline what I did for 11.1, because the readings are not great in guiding us through the assignment, in my opinion. You may agree or disagree with how I approached the assignment, but hopefully this will be helpful.

For the first part of the assignment, it's pretty straightforward, just input the k and n values into the formula and plot the graph. The idea is that we see how the graph changes over time, as more success/failure information comes in. Here is the code that I used:

### No data collected. k = 0, n = 0.
```{r echo=TRUE}
p = seq(0,1, length=100)
# No data collected. k = 0, n = 0.
k=0
n=0
plot(p, dbeta(p, (k+1), (n-k+1)), ylab="density", type ="l", col="blue")
```

Just run this 4 times, with the different k and n values.

For the second part, here is the link that I used for the binomial test. What I did was create a data frame to sum the successes and failures, to gett the overall probabiility of success, and then run the binomial tests for each success/failure counts scenario.

```{r echo=TRUE}
resultFrame <- data.frame(n = c(0,2,15,500), k = c(0,2,4,132))
str(resultFrame)
probSuccess = sum(resultFrame$k)/sum(resultFrame$n)
probSuccess

succRateEst <- binom.test(2, 2, probSuccess)
succRateEst
